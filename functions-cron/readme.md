# App Engine Cron with Google Cloud Functions for Firebase
Google App Engine provides a Cron service. Using this service for scheduling and
Google Cloud Pub/Sub for distributed messaging, you can build an application to
reliably schedule tasks which can trigger Google Cloud Functions.

This sample contains two components:

* An App Engine application, that uses App Engine Cron Service
    to relay cron messages to Cloud Pub/Sub topics.

* A sample Cloud Function which triggers hourly.

## Configuration

By default this sample triggers hourly, daily, and weekly. If you want to
customize this schedule for your app then you can modify the [cron.yaml](/appengine/cron.yaml).

For details on configuring this, please see the [cron.yaml Reference](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/cronref)
in the App Engine documentation.

## Deploying
The overview for configuring and running this sample is as follows:

### 1. Prerequisites

* If you donâ€™t already have one, create a
    [Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp).

* Create a Developers Console project.
    1. Install (or check that you have previously installed)
        * [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
        * [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
        * [Python `pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html)
        * [Google Cloud SDK](http://cloud.google.com/sdk/)
    2. [Enable the Pub/Sub API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=pubsub&redirect=https://console.cloud.google.com)
    3. [Enable Project Billing](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6293499#enable-billing)


### 2. Clone this repository

To clone the GitHub repository to your computer, run the following command:

    $ git clone https://github.com/firebase/functions-cron

Change directories to the `functions-cron` directory. The exact path
depends on where you placed the directory when you cloned the sample files from
GitHub.

    $ cd functions-cron

Leave the default cron.yaml as is for now to run through the sample.

### 3. Deploy to App Engine

1. Configure the `gcloud` command-line tool to use the project your Firebase project.
```
$ gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
```
2. Change directory to `appengine/`
```
$ cd appengine/
```
3. Install the Python dependencies
```
$ pip install -t lib -r requirements.txt
```
4. Create an App Engine App
```
$ gcloud app create
```
5. Deploy the application to App Engine.
```
$ gcloud app deploy app.yaml \cron.yaml
```
6. Open [Google Cloud Logging](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer) and in the right dropdown select "GAE Application". If you don't see this option, it may mean that App Engine is still in the process of deploying.
7. Look for a log entry calling `/_ah/start`. If this entry isn't an error, then you're done deploying the App Engine app.

### 3. Deploy to Google Cloud Functions for Firebase

1. Ensure you're back the root of the repository (`cd ..`, if you're coming from Step 2)
1. Deploy the sample `hourly_job` function to Google Cloud Functions
```
$ firebase deploy --only functions --project <FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID>
```
**Warning:** This will remove any existing functions you have deployed.
If you have existing functions, move the example from [functions/index.js](functions/index.js)
into your project's `index.js`

### 4. Verify your Cron Jobs
We can verify that our function is wired up correctly by opening the [Task Queue](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/taskqueues) tab in AppEngine and
clicking on **Cron Jobs**. Each of these jobs has a **Run Now** button next to it.

The sample functions we deployed only has one function: `hourly_job`. To trigger
this job, let's hit the **Run Now** button for the `/publish/hourly-tick` job.

Then, go to your terminal and run...

```
$ firebase functions:log --project <FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID>
```

You should see a successful `console.log` from your `hourly_job`.

### 5. You're Done!

Your cron jobs will now "tick" along forever. As I mentioned above, you're not
limited to the `hourly-tick`, `daily-tick` and `weekly-tick` that are included
in the AppEngine app. You can add more scheduled functions by modifying the [cron.yaml](/appengine/cron.yaml) file and re-deploying.
