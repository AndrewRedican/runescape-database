## Prologue

I am bored.
I have decided to host and participate my own "hackathon" this weekend.
I will be the single participant -and judge. (Perhaps will share this with co-workers at the end.)

## Rules

1. My first commit will start effective immediately.
2. My final commit should be before Monday August 6, 2018 at 12:01 am (local time).
3. I can use other repositories including my own.

## Objectives
1. See how far my technical skills / knowledge have developed.
2. Build something for bragging rights and improve my Github resume.

## Project Description

1. I will publish a live web app that provides a single admin user (me), the abbility to collect data from [*RuneScape*](http://runescape.com)'s [*Grand Exchange Database API*](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Application_programming_interface).
2. This web application should let anyone navigate information/contents. Only a single admin user (me) should have control over application settings.
3. Setup up customizable backend functions that help me collect new updates from the RS database.
4. Display some graphs and trends.
5. Good Documentation:
   + Provide relevant documentation to setup and host web app for anyone.
   + Provide relevant comments to code.
   + Provide good commit descriptions.

I would like to add more, but I also tend to be overconfident. That's it for now, should this be successful I may continue adding more to this.
